What works : 

- Nav Bar on each page redirect to the correct pages. 
- Park Search : 
	* Drop down menu for Park Name and States with respective search buttons (Choosing one ensures that the other doesn't take a value)
	* When page is loaded, all results are shown to help user begin refining the search. 
	* On clicking filled states, information about the national parks within the state shows up. ( When a park is in more than one state, all of them will show 		up).
	* Search button which results in query returns showing up on our page.  

- Species Search : 
	* Drop Down menu for Park Name, State, Category and search fields for other fields. 
	* A search can be done using any one or more of the search fields. 
	* The map highlights the states in which the species occur (by use of which national parks the species are in). 

- About Page : 
	* Contains information about us and the data we're working with. 

- Home Page : 
	* Contains a website description and how to use it.  


Wishlist : 

- A faster all species search, this takes a second to load. 
- Cascading Search Bars 
- A more elegant way to move from parks to species page 
- Maybe a hover for our map, we like the way it works now but possibly.
- Search on hitting the enter button on the keyboard

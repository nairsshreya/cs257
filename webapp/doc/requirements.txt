Description
Biodiversity in National Parks https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity

This dataset contains information on biodiversity found in 56 national parks in the US. It has general data on each state park and further has information on each species within a park, containing data on their class, whether it is native or not. This could be really interesting to work with to have searches specific for each park  etc.


General Information 
 Park search bar : Park_Name, State
 Species search bar : Scientific_name/Common_name, Category, Order, Family, Park, State, (underneath checkbox for Nativeness : native non-native)

Data Stories
STORY : A park ranger wants to find some general information about a park. 
IMPLEMENTATION : Two pathways.
    1) Park search bar to look up park name/drop down bar with all the parks we have. This leads user to a map with icons on it, these icons can be clicked on and lead to an information page about the park. 
    2) Search by state code - could lead to several parks on the map page. Again, click on icon to get information about the park. 
    
STORY : A tourist is really interested in Yosemite. They want to know more information about species within the park.
IMPLEMENTATION : Two pathways. 
    1. Species search bar - here they would enter 'Yosemite' in park field. This displays a table with information about all the species found there. Search can be refined with occurrence, nativeness or specification in the earlier fields with a search bar on top. Map displayed to highlight area/state of park. 
    2. From a park specific search - click on icon for 'Yosemite' and click on 'Species Information' button at the bottom, this will lead you to a similar page as the previous example.

STORY : A naturalist is really interested in vascular plants. They want to know more information about species in this category and where unique species can be found.
IMPLEMENTATION : 
In species search bar, they would fill out 'vascular plant' for the category field. This would result in a map that highlights every park that has vascular plants and also an info table that has all occurances of vascular plants.






Optional Features : 

1. Search park by state - can zoom into a state and display individual locations. 
2. Model species search bar after library databases, (optional fields)
3. Substring based dropdown menu that adjusts options based on current search string.
4. Map zooms in on a state or park when searched.
